Unique piece of furniture than can be used as either a platform bed or futon.  Queen size.  If used as a futon a traditional queen sized futon mattress would not fit well, it needs what I think is called a waterfall style to be the perfect fit as it's a tri fold style (just want to be upfront).  I've never used that and just had the full size futon mattress and actually like that since it was a more snug fit and stayed put better without slipping.  Can also be used with a regular queen mattress as a platform style frame.  Nice hardwood quality piece of furniture.  Very sturdy.  Because of the tri fold design it will probably fit in the back of some SUV's (or a minivan) if your seats fold down which is how I got it home.  Asking $30 and would like it gone ASAP.

Hi,
I have one safety first smooth ride travel system (car seat, car seat base and compatible stroller) for sale. It is brand new, unused, unopened and in original packaging. This is available for $100. 
Also selling a dining set (table and 6 chairs. The pictures show 5 - 4 regular chairs and 1 captains chair but there is one more captains chair that is part of this set). This table is solid wood, very sturdy and heavy. It is also big. Currently measures 66 inches in length, 42 inches in width and 30 inches height. The length can be extended by another 36 inches using the extenders ( in pictures) depending on how big your dining area is. Ours wasn't big enough so we removed the extenders. Even without the extenders the table is huge. All of this ( dining table, 6 chairs and extenders) for only $150. A new set similar to this can cost more than $1500. 
Also selling a Weslo 5.2t crosswalk treadmill for $200. This is only a year old and hasn't been used much. Speed can go up to 10 mph and 2 manual incline settings.

This is an heirloom piece of furniture and is only reluctantly offered for sale. Dimensions are as follows: just under 81"" high, 20"" deep, doors 32"" on face but actual full width a hair shy of 39"", as it sits kitty-corner afterall. If the ad is posted it's available so no need to answer ""is it still available?"" inquiries. Thanks!

The doors open and allow you to access the single, full length storage area within.

What you are reading in the title is true. Owner paid 600 to reupholster this chair because it belonged to his Mother. It came out great. Beautifully upholstered and in mint shape. Pictures are not that great. Its adorable and about half the size of an adult chair. I can comfortably sit in it myself. From the floor to the top of the back rest measures 31in. The arm rests from Side to side is 28in. From the floor to the seat cushion is 16in. Please dont hit me up with unreasonable offers. He is already losing hundreds of dollars on this.

Beautiful cedar chest and also cedar drawer.  It could be used as a hope chest or blanket chest while also functioning as an  accent piece or TV console.  Strong piece made very well.  Refinished in layers of grey, blue, and white.  Naturally distressed with a few nicks and imperfections (can't see in pictures but will point out in person) and purposely distressed to look weathered.  Knobs painted flat black.  Several layers of sealant for a durable, natural looking finish with a very smooth feel.  There is the one drawer and it functions perfectly.  Top opens perfectly by pushing in lock.  No key.  Definitely a beachy look or cottage chic, farm house look!  Price is low, reflects imperfections, and is therefore firm.  Cash only please.  Delivery may be available locally and if seen/inspected/paid for first.  Reasonable delivery fee.

This vintage American-made Temple-Stuart hutch was purchased in the early to mid-seventies, has been in a smoke-free, pet-free home and is in absolutely flawless condition. This is from the Pioneer Treasury Collection Rockingham model.
This isn't cheap, imported or put together yourself furniture that you buy today and throw away tomorrow.
It is made from maple hardwood by American Craftsmen and during a time when quality built actually meant something. This is a solid, high-quality piece of furniture that will last for generations. It features two drawers with quality dove-tail joints, one that's double wide and the other standard size with a removable silverware holder and three doors below that open for full width storage.
The top section also has three doors with glass inserts and shelves for more storage. Nice tight joints on the corners proves again that this is a high-end piece of furniture that was built to last.
The bottom section measures 56Wx19-1/2Dx33-1/4H
The top measures 52Wx11Dx39/3/4.

We started this business upon a very simple premise: A huge need for quality constructed and fair priced bunk and loft beds. It is our goal to provide something special for your child - a piece of furniture that combines practicality with good craftsmanship, a bed they will have for years to come.

All beds are strong enough for adults. Great for college students, ski lodges, limited space bedrooms and summer camps also. 
Our beds are made thinking of your children, but are strong enough for adults. 
Loft beds start at $425 for a stained twin size bed with one removable safety rail.
Bunk beds start at $495 for a stained twin over twin with one removable safety rail.

We acquired this fine set in 1988 from Warner Interiors Fine Furniture Gallery, Westlake, Ohio. The original reciept is availble if you are interested.
5 very high quality pieces in tastefully carved dark wood.
--4-Poster Queen Bed (Mattress and box spring not included)
--Dresser: 63"" wide x 19 1/2"" deep x 31"" high with 10 drawers
--Mirror: 29 1/4"" wide x 47"" high
--Two Night Stands:  24 1/2"" wide x 16 1/2"" deep x  25"" high with 4 drawers and a pull out board at the top of each
As you can see in the pictures, this set is in used condition with several small blemishes. If we keep the set we'll address these with a furniture touch-up marker. But for the purposes of this listing we wanted to show the flaws as best we could. 
If you are only interested in the bed, dresser and mirror, we'd sell just those for $1200 and keep the two night stands.

I have a collection of 18 very nice Steelcase rolling office chairs that are no longer needed. These are gently used, but in good shape. Each chair adjusts in several ways for just the right fit. These adjustments include padded arm rests that can be raised or lowered and can be pulled tighter to your body or pushed farther apart depending on your body shape. You may also raise and lower the seat and the back, allow it to recline or not, and move the seat in and out to accomodate your leg length.
The chairs are on wheels and are a nice dark gray color. They will look great in your office, at home or around a conference room table. Brand new, these would cost several hundred dollars each. You can buy these today for only $75 each. Please email for directions.    ",Nice Gray Rolling Executive Office Chairs by Steelcase.

For sale is a truly beautiful bed that will make your child smile. 
This is for the bed ONLY and no mattress or linens, however, the picture of it all set up gives you a good idea of how amazing this bed will look. This is not one of those cheepo beds, but a USA made steel and cast iron materials, by Wesley Adams, a top manufacturer of metal beds.
The bed is in great condition and there were a few nicks from use, so I applied a nice fresh coat of paint on the back portion. This can be used as just a single bed, or the lower trundle rolls out and then can be left low, or pop up to the same level as the main bed.
This is truly a beautiful piece with all of the intricate details. Paid over $1000, so this is a GREAT deal.

Picnic Tables
I build Custom built picnic tables to order. Starting at 4' Feet for $85, 6' for $100, 8' for $125, 10' for $150. Any length desired I can build for you. If you have seen a table with separate benches I build those as well. Constructed of non pressure treated or ACQ pressure treated($50 Extra because of the higher price of ACQ lumber), your choice. Tables legs and seat supports are built with 2x6s, not the flimsy 2x4s others builders on craigslist are using. All tables are screwed with premium decking screws, not nailed making them very sturdy. Screw holes are all countersunk to give the table a clean look. Table ends and seat edges are angled off and sanded to ensure a nice finish. Tables ends are also capped giving a finished look. These tables are top notch and the prices can't be beat! Delivery in Canterbury is free, all other deliveries 65 cents per mile from Canterbury to your destination. Fast turn around on all tables, don't wait around for your table! Thank you for looking.

Our latest creation is a 7' Farmer's Table. These tables are built one at a time over a period of weeks. This gorgeous piece features an antique white painted crackle finished base with a red underlaid base coat to give it the look of a generations-old dining table. The top is finished with a custom stain, hand rubbed in several layers to give it depth and bring out the grains and knots of the wood. It is distressed throughout as an old farmer's table would be.  Several coats of polyurethane and a final layer of wax make the table shine. 
This table features pegged mortise and tenon joinery for unmatched strength and durability. Mortise and tenon is considered the strongest joint possible in furniture building and has been used for hundreds of years.  Eastern white pine is used for the entire table.  This dining table measures 7' in length and 37"" in width.

Pottery Barn Kids Thomas bedroom set in Sun Valley Honey.
Includes: 
Twin bed
Trundle bed 
Tall bureau
Night stand
Sturdy hard wood. We had one white set for daughter and this one for son, and the quality was far more superior in this set even though they both were Pottery Barn. This is a sturdy, well built set.
Description from the Pottery Barn brochure:
Timeless style and lasting durability make the Thomas Collection a perennial favorite.
Wide beadboard paneling, hefty ball finials and frame-and-panel construction capture the warmth and hardiness of early American designs. 
Masterfully constructed for enduring style, all pieces are framed in pine and feature long-lasting mortise and tenon joinery.
Our multi-step finishing process accentuates the distressing of the wood, and is sealed with two layers
of protective lacquer.

Adjustable Burgundy Office Chairs by Herman Miller.  
Discount for purchase of multiple chairs: 2 for $60; 4 for $100.
These high quality chairs were very expensive when new.  Buy for a small fraction of the cost when new. 
Forget Staples and Walmart.  These chairs will cost less and last far longer than any new office chair from the big discount stores.
See full description below from manufacturer:
The Equa XR ergonomic work chair by Herman Miller was designed to promote the comfort, health, and well-being of people who must sit to work. The shape of the chair's patented 1-piece shell and its advanced materials pitch in to provide optimum back support as you sit up, lean back, stretch, reach, and move at your desk. 
Designed by Aeron chair designers Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick, the light and strong, flexible and supportive Equa was named TIME magazine's Design of the Decade. 
* Easy to clean 
* Comfortable, continuous back support from patented 1-piece shell 
* Biomechanical knee-tilt mechanism eliminates pressure points on underside of thighs as chair reclines, promoting healthy circulation 
* H-shaped cutout allows air to circulate, relieving heat build-up 
* Thick, foam padding with waterfall edges won't catch clothing 
* Super-stable 5-star base 
* Pneumatic seat height adjustment

I am moving/downsizing and selling some nice items at great prices.  Listed here is an 8-piece dining room set by Kincaid.  It is sturdy and solid and, while it shows normal wear, it is in good overall condition.  I have had this set a while and can't remember what kind of wood it is but I believe it is solid mahogany.  The table comes with a total of six chairs, four shown here, and two leafs.  The measurements, measured without the leafs, and more details are below:
     Length - 66""
     Width - 43 ½""
     Height - 30 ½""
     Two table leafs - 17 ¾""/ea.
     Pull out drawer at each end
Full disclosure - There is a 4"" scratch on the top of one of the chairs that occurred during my recent move.  I believe it could easily be covered with a stain stick.  There is also small tear on that seat cushion.  I bought the set with neutral ready-to-be-upholstered fabric, which I never did, but you may want to consider doing that.
If you have any questions about this set, don't hesitate to ask.",DINING TABLE SET W/6 CHAIRS BY KINCAID,https://nh.craigslist.org/fuo/6170557470.html,$300,good

This piece is beautiful, my buddy made this for me as a gift a few years ago and circumstances have led me to downsize. I simply can't use this anymore where I am living.

It also comes with a modest foot board if you wish, maybe this could be one of your summer DIY projects and magically turn it into a bar, or a bench, haha. 
Anyway, please text me for  more info.

Really great old railroad cart from the 1800's.
Industrial cast iron and wood frame. Solid, quality construction. Built to last. Rolls and turns very smoothly and quietly to this day.
Original platform planks are pretty rough. Small piece broken off one of them. Stained with grease, as this cart spent some time being used in an auto mechanic's shop. Still a great piece.
Could be converted into a coffee table if you elevated a piece of glass 5"" over it at coffee table height, using the original platform underneath as storage. A few coats of polyurethane would seal the original wood, even with the staining. Or planks could easily be replaced with barn board. Any of these options I could do for you, for additional cost.

I build Custom built picnic tables to order. Starting at 4' Feet for $85, 6' for $100, 8' for $125, 10' for $150. Any length desired I can build for you. If you have seen a table with separate benches I build those as well. Constructed of non pressure treated or ACQ pressure treated($50 Extra because of the higher price of ACQ lumber), your choice. Tables legs and seat supports are built with 2x6s, not the flimsy 2x4s others builders on craigslist are using. All tables are screwed with premium decking screws, not nailed making them very sturdy. Screw holes are all countersunk to give the table a clean look. Table ends and seat edges are angled off and sanded to ensure a nice finish. Tables ends are also capped giving a finished look. These tables are top notch and the prices can't be beat! Delivery in Canterbury is free, all other deliveries 65 cents per mile from Canterbury to your destination. Fast turn around on all tables, don't wait around for your table! Thank you for looking.

I have for your consideration one of the nicest looking custom made Tack trunks your going to find and at a nice savings over the typical square boxes you'll find out there for $1,000.00. It has three separate storage areas that you can lock and has pistons to aid in lowering the lid of the second compartment. This Trunk was used but barely as you can see from the photos and is in excellent almost new condition. It's on hidden wheels for easy moving and is simply a gorgeous custom made piece that's more like a fine piece of furniture. All reasonable offers considered.
Outside measurement is Length = 36"" Width = 23 1/2"" Height = 38"". It would be best to see it in person for the interior measurements to see if they fit your specific needs.

Selling a brand new leather chair. Actually I'm pretty sure it's faux leather. This isn't some gorgeous leather historical arm chair that would go in front of a fireplace in a mansion, but it's decent for what it is. It is a dark brown. Note that there are little specks of water-based white paint on it from painting too close to it. It's water-based though so it should come up. I'll leave it to the buyer though. You probably know a better way to do it than I do, and I don't want to make a hack of it. Otherwise, it's brand new. I don't think we've ever even sat in it.
Oh and it's 28"" wide, 32"" deep, and 34.5"" tall at the back.

A mid-century, Danish modern, Alvar Aalto-style, guitar pick shaped, bentwood birch coffee / side table, manufacturer unknown. Alvar Aalto, a forefather of Scandinavian Modern design, his designs are instantly recognizable for their curvaceous, bentwood frames. This table features Aalto's patented bent birch wood L-shaped legs and lacquered birch veneer top. The triangular, guitar-pick shape was a favorite in the late 60's and early 70's, and would compliment a mid-century style home.
The table is structurally sound and is in good condition but has two areas of more significant scratches to the birch top (see pics) and the price reflects this. Dimensions are: 16""H x 18 1/4"" W x 21 1/2"" L.

For sale is an Ikea Galant Right Corner Desk. I don't know what they call the color but it's like a medium brown/darker honey veneer. They don't make the Galant anymore which is too bad as the Bekant is not as modular and well made as the Galant...least in my opinion. This is the desk for gamers, specially if you get the extensions!
Desk is in good shape, has one long scratch on it, might be able to fix, bit isn't that bad (See picture). Also has one mug spot where the clear coat needs to be fixed, all said and done it cleans up nice.
I'm missing one leg bolt, you can buy a similar replacement bolt which will work fine at Lowes or Home Depot for a buck. You can also get replacement bolts from Ikea, I know as I got extra bolts for another Galant desk I have from Ikea for free.

Here is a Slate Mosaic Table with 4 Matching Chairs and Cushions for each seat.  This set has been stored exclusively inside.  It was on display and not used.  The table measures 36"" in diameter.  I'm not sure if the framing is wrought iron or steel but the furniture is heavy and ready to stand the test of time.  This is perfect for a patio, porch, sunroom or dinette.
The beautiful set will be a wonderful addition to any home.  This heavy duty set is ready for everyday use and is easy to clean.  The cushions add the perfect touch.  All from a smoke free/pet free home.

Set of two mid-century modern wire lounge chairs in excellent original condition!
Made by Homecrest circa 1960's
Original olive green vinyl upholstered cushions and armrests. Some minor cracking on the armrests, and one small tear in one of the back cushions, but overall amazing condition considering their age! It is very rare to find these chairs with the original cushions. They were mostly all thrown away decades ago. These chairs were originally advertised as patio loungers, and were often used outdoors. This pair however was always kept inside and well taken care of. The frames are original paint, and rust free!
They swivel, they rock, and they are very, very comfortable chairs with sleek, vintage modern design.

I have these fine pendant lamps that didn't match our new kitchen plan, so we're letting them go. There's a single pendant for over the sink plus a 3-pendant unit that can go over a table or island.

The lights are reddish-orange-y in color from the side when lit up, but provide a nice even light on the surface underneath (sometimes hard to tell from the picture).
